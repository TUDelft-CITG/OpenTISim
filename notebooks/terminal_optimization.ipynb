    "### 1 Scenario Generator\n",
    "Generates a demand scenario for three commodities: maize, soybean and wheat, which is then fed into the simulator. Each demand trajectory consists out of a historic demand component and a scenario component. The scenario component can be created linearly, exponentially, exponentially linked to random seeding or can be predefined.\n",
    "### 2 Simulator\n",
    "Iterates through every year within the simulation window, is fed with demand scenario (see chapter 1), initial terminal setup and a list of investment triggers. All in all, the simulator produces a single *terminal* variable, under which all infrastructure and financial components are grouped (e.g. terminal.quays, terminal.capex, terminal.NPV etc.)\n",
    "### 3 Investment Triggers Iteration\n",
    "Runs the simulator (chapter 2) multiple times, while slightly changing each investment trigger. The resulting *terminal* variables are saved in a list after which the impact of each trigger alteration can be visualised.\n",
    "### 4 Risk Sensitivity Iteration\n",
    "Runs the simulator (chapter 2) multiple times, while slight changing the presumed risk (quantified as weighted average cost of capital (WACC)). The resulting *terminal* variables are saved in a list after which the sensitivit to risk can be visualised.\n",
    "### 5 Single Simulation Run \n",
    "Runs a single simulation (chapter 2) using predefined triggers\n",
    "### 6 Plots\n",
    "Result visualisations"
